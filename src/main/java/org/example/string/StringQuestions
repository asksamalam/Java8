🧩 Top String Coding Questions (With Difficulty Levels)
✅ Basic Level

Reverse a String
→ Example: "Java" → "avaJ"

Check if a String is Palindrome
→ Example: "madam" → true

Count the number of vowels and consonants in a String
→ Example: "Hello" → vowels = 2, consonants = 3

Count the number of words in a sentence
→ Example: "I love Java" → 3

→ Example: "banana" → {b=1, a=3, n=2}

Check if two Strings are Anagrams
→ Example: "listen" & "silent" → true

Remove all white spaces from a String
→ Example: "Java Developer" → "JavaDeveloper"

Convert a String to a character array and vice versa

Compare two Strings without using equals() method

Change the case of each character
→ "Java" → "jAVA"

⚙️ Intermediate Level

Find the first non-repeating character in a String
→ Example: "swiss" → 'w'

Find the first repeated character in a String
→ Example: "programming" → 'r'

Check if String contains only digits
